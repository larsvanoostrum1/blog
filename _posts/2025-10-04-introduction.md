In this blog, I will try to post about a variety of subjects I find interesting. This will mainly be around applying math, econometrics and data science to sports, just what triggers my interest at the time.

During the summer, I first started applying the knowledge from my Econometrics studies when I heard that decisions by the Dutch Judo Federation (JBN) where partially based on an Elo rating. Since I knew about the Elo rating from chess, it immediately sparked an interest in me, and some days later I had coded an Elo rating using match-data from the IJF myself.

Since then, I have been puzzling with more projects, as a way to fill my spare time. Some things are quite interesting to figure out, and getting some extra practise for writing my MSc thesis next year also wouldn't hurt.

Have fun!
